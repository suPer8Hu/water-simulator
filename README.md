Research project-water flow simulator

See 4-project.txt attached.

## This dynamic web project features an interactive three-dimensional water simulation, crafted with the robust Three.js library, 
deployed on an HTML canvas. Users can add ripples and waves by interacting directly or through the interface controls.To enrich 
the sensory experience, audio integration plays atmospheric sounds matching the visual effects, such as a rainstorm, which is 
activated via a button. The simulation includes several HTML buttons like "Add Random Drops," which introduces spontaneous water
droplets onto the surface, and a "Rainstorm" button that simulates the intense effect of a downpour, accompanied by corresponding 
audio. There's also a "Reset" button that returns the simulation to its initial state, clearing all visual and audio effects to a 
pristine starting point. Key technical aspects include the use of WebGL shaders for realistic water rendering, audio handling 
through the Web Audio API for real-time sound effects, and the use of raycasting for interactive droplet addition.
